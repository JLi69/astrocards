About Astrocards
----------------
Astrocards is a fun little flashcard game that I have created in order to help with memorization of things such as vocabulary, times tables, and more! 

The motivation for this game was that if you had to quickly answer flashcards in order to gain points and avoid getting a game over, then you would slowly get better after many rounds of repetition and you would slowly improve over time - and it hopefully should be somewhat entertaining at the same time!

How to play
-----------
Your main goal is to protect a planet and avoid having it be destroyed by asteroids and obtain the highest score possible.

At the bottom of the screen you have a space where you can input your 'answer' to an asteroid on the screen. If you get it correct, then the asteroid will be destroyed. However, if you are too slow then the aasteroid will hit the planet and explode and you will lose one hit point. You start with 5 hit points.

As you destroy more asteroids, you will eventually 'level up' and more asteroids will spawn at a faster rate also fall down at a faster rate. Additionally, 'red asteroids' will spawn which are extra dangerous - if you enter a wrong answer you will take one hit of damage and if it makes it to the bottom of the screen, the asteroid will destroy the planet and you will lose! Be careful!

See how high of a score you can get before the asteroids overwhelm you.

Good luck and enjoy! :)
