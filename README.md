# Astrocards

Astrocards is a fun little flashcard game that I have created in order to help 
with memorization of things such as vocabulary, times tables, and more! 

The motivation for this game was that if you had to quickly answer flashcards 
in order to gain points and avoid getting a game over, then you would slowly 
get better after many rounds of repetition and you would slowly improve over 
time - and it hopefully should be somewhat entertaining at the same time!
